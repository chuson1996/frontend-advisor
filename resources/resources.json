So, most likely I\nhad no understanding at all. As a result of this I thought I rediscover monads\nmyself using JavaScript. The plan was basically the same as that used when I\nderived the Y Combinator: start from the initial problem (dealing with\nexplicit immutable state in this case), and work my way up to the solution by\napplying simple code transformations."

    "description": "Much like Language Integrated Query (LINQ), Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. They, like LINQ, are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate aggregates.  There are two major libraries currently out there, Cognitect's transducer-js and James Long's transducers.js which are both great for getting high performance over large amounts of data.  Because it is collection type neutral, it is a perfect fit for RxJS to do transformations over large collections."
